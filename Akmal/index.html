<title>My Life During the MCO</title>

<p>  Hello my name is Mohammad Akmal Bin Abd Wahab from BA232 2A and I want to share to everyone about my life during the Movement Control Order (MCO). I will talk about my experience during the 1st week of the MCO, during the 1st week of the MCO, my friends and I cannot go out from the campus. 
</p>

<p>
We all just playing video games all day but sometimes we get bored. Due to MCO, all the students cannot go out to buy food or anything but luckily UITM have provided all the UITM students free food during this MCO. UITM give food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My daily life has changed during the MCO, I always lack of sleep because of playing video games with my friends. After getting bored playing video games, I will search for a movie and watch it. My sleeping schedule is worse during the MCO.
</p>

<p>In the third week of MCO, the Online Distance Learning has started. To be honest, I don’t really prepared for the Online Distance Learning (ODL) but after a few days I can catch up the Online Distance Learning. The internet connection is the main problem during the Online Distance Learning. If the internet connection has problem, it will affect my learning. 
</p>
<p>That’s all for my life during the Movement Control Order (MCO). Assalamualaikum and Salam Ramadhan, and Happy Fasting to all Muslim.</p>
